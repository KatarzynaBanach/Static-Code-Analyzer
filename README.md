## Static Code Analyzer

It is a simple static analyzer tool that finds common stylistic issues in Python code such as:
- Indentation is not a multiple of four
- Unnecessary semicolon after a statement
- Less than two spaces before inline comments
- TODO found
- More than two blank lines preceding a code line
- Too many spaces after 'class' / 'def'.
- Function argument, variable name that don't use snake_case
- Class name that don't use CamelCase

Technologies used:
- python
- libraries: **_ast, re, argparse, pathlib_**

Created while doing a course 'Python Core' on hyperskill.org, based on general schema and guidelines provided by course author (but solutions designed on my own). During this challenge I got familiar with ast and pathlib library, and mastered my re library skills.
